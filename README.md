Random stuff that I wrote long time ago:

##### csrf_plugin 

POC for testing CSRF webapps. Is a burp plugin able to regenerate CSRF prevention tokens when doing automatic scans.
This has not been adapted to the latest Burp's plugin API.

##### injection_CSRF

Tomcat 7 application featuring CSRF protection and with a simple SQLi vulnerability.

##### certlookup.py 

certlookup is a tool for performing reverse IP lookups interrogating SSL servers for certificate's CN attribute. Handy when you have a bunch of web servers IPs and you don't know the web site name.

##### burpstrike

An old project trying to bring Proxystrike within burp suite. 
This has not been adapted to the latest Burp's plugin API.
